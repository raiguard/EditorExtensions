  Info:
    - This is a BREAKING UPDATE. Your existing testing setups will no longer function as they once did.
  Features:
    - Added per-player setting to automatically enable alt-mode
    - Infinity loaders can snap to belt ghosts
  Changes:
    - Changed the default toggle editor hotkey to Control + Alt + E
    - Infinity loader and linked belt no longer snap belt type. Instead, they are always at the max belt speed
    - Infinity loader only supports a single filter; to put a different item on each half of a belt, use two loaders
    - Infinity loaders will only snap when they are built; they will not snap when you place or rotate a belt in front of them
    - Map editor availability is gated behind the "toggle map editor" permission
    - Removed the '/cheatmode' command in favor of the built-in '/cheat' command
      - Consequently, you can no longer enable cheat mode without disabling achievements in your game
    - Testing labs will sync active research to parent force by default (can be disabled)
  Optimizations:
    - Significantly reduced infinity loader UPS impact
  Compatibility:
    - Added remote interface to enable or disable testing recipes
    - Testing recipes will not automatically enable when entering cheat mode; `/cheat` must be used explicitly
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed several edge cases with infinity loader filters and snapping
    - Fixed that entering then exiting the testing lab when personal robots were deployed would leave them behind in the lab world
    - Fixed that inventory sync would function outside of cheat mode
